Produce a structured YouTube video summary suitable for publishing as video notes.

Sections (Markdown):
- Title: one line, synthesized if not present in transcript
- Overview: 2–3 sentences describing the video’s purpose and audience
- Key Takeaways: 5–10 concise bullets
- Timestamps/Chapters: bullets with mm:ss – short label (only if times are present; otherwise omit)
- Resources & Links: bullets for any mentioned URLs, repos, or documents (if none, omit)
- Calls To Action: 2–4 short bullets (subscribe, next steps, downloads, etc.)

Rules
- Only output Markdown.
- Omit sections that aren’t supported by the transcript.
- If uncertain, say “Unknown” instead of inventing details.
